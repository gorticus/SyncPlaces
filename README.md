# SyncPlaces Firefox extension

SyncPlaces is the most excellent [Firefox](http://getfirefox.com)
extension that provides for bookmark and password synchronization to a
self-hosted server, external device, or commercially hosted service,
e.g., [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com).  Originally developed and published
by [Andy Halford](http://andyhaldford.com) (AH), the author stopped
distributing it in June 2012 and removed it from from Firefox add-ons,
citing displeasure at Mozilla's treatment of add-on developers. [Daniel
Lange](http://daniel-lange.com) (DL) maintains a page dedicated to
[SyncPlaces, SortPlaces (CheckPlaces, SearchPlaces)... preserving these
and other excellent Firefox add-ons](http://goo.gl/utAO3P).

# What this is ...

I rely on AH's SyncPlaces. It is an essential add-on for me.  

This repository will:
* host `.xpi` releases for easy user use,
* host the source for development by user community,
* aggregate minimal updates, scrounged from various places, to enable
  continued use in fast moving Firefox updates.

I will attempt to update it as my limited time permits.

# What this is not ...

I _will not_:
* add features, so please, refrain from asking,
* plan regular updates

# xpi file info

The `.xpi` prior to `v5.2.0` were obtained from the `belnet.be` Mozilla
mirror, as suggested by [DL](http://goo.gl/utAO3P), before it's layout
was reworked and the plugins deleted due to resync.  As of 2014/10/31,
`ftp://ftp.belnet.be/mirror/ftp.mozilla.org/` no longer mirrors Mozilla.

`v5.2.0`, which can be obtained from [DL's](http://goo.gl/utAO3P) site,
is not included here, since it differs significantly from `v5.1.0 on
which the current updates are based.
